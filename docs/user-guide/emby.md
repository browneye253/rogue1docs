# Getting Started With Emby

## Emby Connect Registration

The quickest way to get logged in on any of your devices is to use Emby Connect.  Emby Connect is the same method you use to login to your Netflix, Hulu or Disney+ accounts.

You'll need to create an Emby Connect account by going to the following page and clicking on Sign Up: [https://emby.media/pin.html](https://emby.media/pin.html){target="_blank"}

On the sign up page fill in the form with your information.  We recommend that your display name not contain spaces.  This is basically your username.  Be sure to save these details somewhere because you'll need them everytime you want to login to a new device.
