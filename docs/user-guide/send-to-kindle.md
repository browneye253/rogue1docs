# Send to Kindle

If you want the ability to email documents and books to yourself you'll need to make a couple of changes to your Amazon account.

Visit this URL or navigate amazon.com through your Account Settings to Manage Your Content and Devices

1. Scroll down to the *Personal Document Settings*
2. Copy the email address for the device you are wanting to send the books to.  If you don't want to memorize the random email that was generated for you by Amazon you can click the edit button next to the email and change it to something else.
3. Under the *Approved Personal Document E-mail List* section you'll want to add a new approved e-mail address. Add any email address you want to be able to receive books.

Once you've finished those steps you should be able to email documents directly to your Kindle.
