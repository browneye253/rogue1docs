# Subtitles

## Subtitle Types

There are basically two types of subtitles. 

- **Subtitle** - these are standard subtitles.  They will present every spoken work as text at the bottom of the screen.
- **Forced Subtitles** - Forced subtitles will only show the subtitle when the language spoken on screen switches to something that is not the same as the audio language.
