- **Display Name** This is essentially your username.  Use whatever you'd like but I'd avoid using spaces.

## Sign In On Your Devices

The quickest way to get logged in on any of your devices is to use Emby Connect.  Emby Connect will allow you to login using the same method you use to login to your Netflix, Hulu or Disney+ accounts.  You'll be presented with a pin number on the device you're attempting to login to.  You'll then use your phone or computer to visit the URL on the screen where you'll login with your Emby Connect account and enter the pin to authorize the device.

To authorize a device using the pin on your screen visit the following URL: [https://emby.media/pin.html](https://emby.media/pin.html){target="_blank"}

![Emby Sign Up / Pin](../assets/images/emby_pin.png){width="300"}

Enter your Emby Connect username and password and the pin number you see on the screen and click Submit.  Give the device a few seconds to receive the registration info and then you're screen will refresh and show you your available servers.  

Select Rogue One and enjoy!
